Loops
Why Loops?

Before we get to writing our own loops, letâ€™s explore what programming would be like if we couldnâ€™t use loops.

Letâ€™s say we have a list of ingredients and we want to print every element in the list:
"""
ingredients = ["milk", "sugar", "vanilla extract", "dough", "chocolate"]
"""
If we only use print(), our program might look like this:
"""
print(ingredients[0])
print(ingredients[1])
print(ingredients[2])
print(ingredients[3])
print(ingredients[4])
"""
The output would be:

milk
sugar
vanilla extract
dough
chocolate

Thatâ€™s still manageable, Weâ€™re writing 5 print() statements (or copying and pasting a few times). Now imagine if we come
back to this program and our list had 10, or 24601, or â€¦ 100,000,000 elements? It would take an extremely long time and
by the end, we could still end up with inconsistencies and mistakes.

Donâ€™t dwell too long on this tedious scenario â€” weâ€™ll learn how loops can help us out in the next exercise. For now,
letâ€™s gain an appreciation for loops.
Instructions
1.

Using 10 print() statements, print out: "This can be so much easier with loops!".

If you already have an idea of how to use loops (or have searched up how to do it) weâ€™re still expecting 10 individual
print() statements.

If for some reason you still are not passing the tests, make sure all your print() statements have the same text "This
can be so much easier with loops!".

Copy and paste is your best friend here ðŸ˜‰
